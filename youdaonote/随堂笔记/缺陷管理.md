3.2 So You Want To Log a Bug...

Anyone can log a bug in Jira, but before doing so you should check in Jira to see if has already been logged by someone else.

If you think the issue is Critical, then don't spend a long time searching Jira, ask your team members on the office or in DingTalk if they are seeing the same issue.

3.3 Logging a Bug

Information Gathering

- Who is reporting the problem?

Which user does this apply to?

Different users will have different roles and associated permissions, and so may have access to different screens, customized landing pages, assets, and business processes. Try to identify if the problem is specific to a role or individual users.

Which organization does the user belong to?

Have other users experienced the same problem? If so, who?

- What is the problem?

What are the exact steps required to reproduce the problem?

Is the problem reproducible using the exact steps provided by the user? If so, try to narrow the steps down to the bare minimum steps required to reproduce the issue. If not, then you may have to rely on any provided screenshots and the system logs.

Are any error messages shown in the UI?

What are the error messages? 

What do the monitoring dashboards show?

If the issue is related to any code snippet information, the recent history of code snippet information and blocks can be found via the monitoring dashboard. 

Check to see if the expected code snippet informations are visible in the history.

Ask the user for screenshots of the problem symptoms if possible.

Are they listed in the error messages support section?

- When did the problem occur?

What time did the user first experience the problem? 

Has the user experienced the problem more than once? 

Knowing this will help you find relevant entries in the monitoring dashboards and system logs.

- Where did the problem occur?

Which client was being used when the problem occurred? 

If a browser, which browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer, etc.), which version, and which operating system were being used?

Root Cause Analysis

- Determine if the problem is a known issue

Check if the problem symptoms match any known issues. If so, apply the published workarounds (if available) and see if they resolve the issue.

- Identify recent changes in application configuration (non-developer)

Can we can find the changes by non-developers in logs or other ways?

- Identify recent changes in system setup

Was the version of current product/platform updated recently? 

Were any changes made to the asset schemas or business processes recently that coincide with the problem first occurring?

- Control the environment while troubleshooting

If possible, ensure that none is making changes to the system while you are troubleshooting. It may not be practical to stop others creating or modifying data, but if the problem appears to be related to a specific asset instance try to avoid others making changes to it while troubleshooting.

3.4 Severities

1 - Critical

- The system is unavailable.

- The system is performing so poorly as to be unusable.

- A business-critical feature or process is not working, and no workarounds are possible.

- Business-critical data loss or corruption has been detected.

- A serious security breach has occurred.

2 - High

- A major feature is not working, and no workarounds are possible.

3 - Medium

- A feature is working incorrectly, but workarounds for the problem are possible (if applicable), or the operation can be achieved in a different way.

- Examples: 

- A field is not mandatory when it should be, and submitting a form without filling in the field causes an error to be returned.

- A field has an incorrect default value.

- A non-critical non-editable field is populated with an incorrect value.

- An API returns an incorrect error code, or incorrect or inappropriate error message.

- A link in the UI navigates to the wrong location.

- The UI allows a user to enter values that are not accepted by the back-end (UI validation issue).

- The UI allows access to a page that the user should not able able to see (UI issue only, the back-end will not allow the operation to go through).

4 - Low

- A cosmetic issue.

- Minor layout, formatting, or other style issues with the product UI, company website, or documentation.

- Minor spelling, grammar, or choice of wording issues with the product UI, company website, or documentation.

- Minor usability issues.

 

3.5 Priority

P0 — 最高级，重要且紧急的缺陷，阻塞了业务流程正常进行；严重性最高，必须被立即解决；

比如，系统崩溃，数据丢失，安装失败，拒绝访问，需求主业务功能未实现，产品logo和其他影响企业品牌形象的界面错误等等。

 

P1 — 高级，较为紧急的缺陷，可能阻碍业务流程；严重性较高，需要紧急关注；

比如，功能实现和需求不一致，业务流程错误，数据一致性问题，比较明显的页面样式问题，登陆功能异常，页面链接错误等等。



P2 — 中级，重要不紧急的缺陷，有影响业务流程的可能性；严重性一般，需要正常排队等待修复或列入软件发布清单；

比如，查询结果的界面展示问题，前端输入限制和检查，打印内容或者格式问题等等。



P3 — 低级，不重要不紧急的缺陷，对业务流程有很小的影响，或者有变通的解决方案；严重性较低，可以在资源充足时被纠正；

比如，不影响业务描述的拼写错误，有歧义的表述，缺少提示信息，页面显示格式问题，严重影响用户体验的等等。



P4 — 最低级，对业务流程影响很轻微，或者发生的概率很小，可以在资源充足时被纠正。

比如，一般的优化建议，用户体验不太友好的。
